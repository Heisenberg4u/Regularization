# Regularization
Here i have explained why there is a need for regularization arises by creating 3 separate files named Lasso(L1) Regression, Ridge Regression(L2) and Plain Logistic Regression. However there is no need to separately make 3 files we can run all codes in one file i will also upload that file where L1,L2 and Linear regression are together applied in the labour training dataset
